### Temporary repo

Several things I've been doing in my ubuntu terminal in the past week have answered my curiosity about distributed version control. And I think knowing some of Git's interesting concepts cheered me up a bit in my emotionally draining final years of study. Hopefully, this will (probably) also be the start of my journey to a new way of development -- parallel workflow. Thanks to me, also especially to Mr. Chacon and Straub for your easy-to-follow book.
